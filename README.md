## Description 

This project was built for devs who would like a quick way to generate a README for their project. If you are like me you are not a huge fan at writing markdown, this application solves just that problem.

## Usage

You will need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine to run this code. Once this is done open up the index.js in terminal and type:

```
npm install
```

This will install all of the required dependencies. Then you can proceed with: 

```
node index.js
```
![Image of application running](./img/app-img.PNG)

This will take you through prompts to generate a well written readme. You will have the option to input a custom image URL as well. If you don't want one AT ALL you will have to just delete the image markdown in the generated readme.
